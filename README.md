# Life XP 🧠⚔️

A personal web-based archive that visualizes my academic and professional journey — not as a list, but as a level-up experience. Think skill trees, XP, character progression, and achievements — all wrapped in a lightweight interactive UI.

## 🔍 What It Is

- 🎓 **Education as Achievements** – Each degree or certification is a collectible textile-style badge.
- 🧱 **Experience as Roles** – Stylized character avatars represent key professional roles I’ve taken on.
- 🌱 **Progress as XP** – Skills, projects, and milestones tracked like a game’s progression system.

No frameworks, no fuss — just HTML, CSS, and JS, crafted with attention to design and storytelling.

## ✨ Highlights

- Badge flip effects with front/back views
- Character-select-style representation of roles (inspired by Persona/Tekken)
- A coherent visual theme tying everything into a single narrative
- Built to be expanded modularly
